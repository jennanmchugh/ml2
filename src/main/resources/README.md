**<h1>Program 1 Instructions</h1>**

**<h2>Part 1</h2>**
<p>Part 1, the Hill-climbing algorithm assignment, is a simple console program. To run it, just open src/main/java/Part 1 and run the 'HillClimber' class. Results will print in the console.</p>

**<h2>Part 2</h2>**
<p>Part 2 is where things get fun. </p>
<p>Go to src/main/java/Part 2/fx and run 'StartProgram'. Soon a Java FX application will open and you will see a 'best-fit' structure drawn for each generation. The generation number and total fitness will appear at the top, along with the sequence string. </p>
<p>Some things to note: `MAX_FITNESS = -9`, `MAX_GENERATIONS = 2000`. Whichever of these conditions are met first will stop the program.
